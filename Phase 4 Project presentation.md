# üìã Phase 4 ‚Äì Project Presentation

## üåü Project Introduction: Why MoodMate?

In today's fast-paced world, many people ‚Äî especially students, busy professionals, and young individuals ‚Äî struggle to stay connected with their emotional well-being.  
I created **MoodMate** to offer a simple, supportive, and accessible tool that helps users reflect on their daily emotions, recognize patterns in their moods, and build better mental health habits over time.

The goal was **not just to track moods**, but to create a positive daily habit of emotional check-ins, self-awareness, and self-growth.  
By making mood tracking effortless and encouraging, **MoodMate** supports users in understanding themselves better, managing stress, and promoting a healthier mindset.

## üõ† Project Scope and Features (Planned in Phase 1)

MoodMate is a **daily journaling and mood tracking web app** focused on:

- **Mood Logging:** Selecting an emoji to represent daily mood + optional text notes.
- **Journal Entry:** Writing deeper reflections for each day.
- **History Tracking:** Viewing past mood logs in a list format.
- **Settings Page:** Customizing personal preferences and managing reminders.
- **Inspirational Quote (Planned but NOT Implemented):** Initially intended, but removed for focusing on core emotional logging features.

The design emphasized a **soft, calming theme**, intuitive navigation, and user-friendly experience to encourage repeated use.

## üîç Reflection and Lessons Learned

Building **MoodMate** helped me understand the importance of balancing **functionality** with **user experience**.  
While I initially planned more features (like a daily quote system), focusing on core emotional logging features made the app stronger and more meaningful.

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Connecting frontend, backend, and database securely.
- Improving user interface for easier navigation and emotional engagement.
- Managing time across phases while ensuring quality delivery.

If I had more time, I would like to implement:
- Graphical mood trend visualization.
- Notification-based mood logging reminders.
